## Usage

Type `yak` and get to work; You'll see a Notification Center reminder pop up in 20 minutes, reminding you to stretch, breathe deeply and get back to work.

Why the keyword `yak`? The expression "yak shaving" refers to being busy without necessarily being productive. The aim of this timer is to help you remember, every 20 minutes, to stay focused and on-task.

Like a pomodoro timer, with less tomatoes and more yaks.

### Time duration

By default, the workflow is set to remind you every 20 minutes, but you can change this timing in the User Configuration. Note that the time is set in seconds.

For quick reference:
- 10 mins: 600 seconds
- 20 mins: 1200 seconds
- 30 mins: 1800 seconds

### Keyword

You can also customise the keyword if `yak` doesn't quite do it for you.

Good luck and have a productive day!
